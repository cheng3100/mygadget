Use this project to download blog as markdown file from zhihu `https://github.com/chenluda/zhihu-download`. It support to use the Edge/chrome plugin  `Tampermonkey` to to this.
But the result md file's img link still be the web link. So add this script to download it to local and replace all the img link inside md file

usage of `md_img_local.py`
`md_img_local.py -f . -p pic`

I have put this script to ~/.bin/ so can invoke it anyplace.
